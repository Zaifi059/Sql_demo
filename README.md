## About the App

This Flutter app, titled "Zaifi Sql Demo," is a simple demonstration of using SQL databases to manage a list of products. Here's an overview of the important files and components in the project:

- `main.dart`: This is the entry point of the application. It sets up the main `MyApp` widget and initializes the Flutter app.

- `MyApp`: The `MyApp` class is a stateless widget that configures the app's title, theme, and the initial screen, which is the `ProductListPage`.

- `ProductListPage`: This is the main screen of the app. It displays a list of products retrieved from an SQL database. Users can view, add, update, and delete products from this screen.

## Functionality

The app allows you to:

- View a list of products.
- Add new products to the database.
- Edit existing products.
- Delete products from the database.
